				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Nowadays, there is a growing interest to hire the services of a web development company in Dubai and elsewhere to develop websites. However, in the initial phase, the freelancers were the preferred choice to work for web design projects because of their love to design creative websites and do the necessary coding. Now the financial factor is gaining in importance and they would rather work for a company dedicated to website development than work as a freelancer. Sadly enough, freelancers now find less time in experimenting with code and images.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-210" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/08/%5E0781FF004037D4B79628A7BE378AF74AD57D9CE673B1B12FA8%5Epimgpsh_fullsize_distr.png" alt="^0781FF004037D4B79628A7BE378AF74AD57D9CE673B1B12FA8^pimgpsh_fullsize_distr" width="954" height="431" srcset="https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/^0781FF004037D4B79628A7BE378AF74AD57D9CE673B1B12FA8^pimgpsh_fullsize_distr-300x136.png 300w, https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/^0781FF004037D4B79628A7BE378AF74AD57D9CE673B1B12FA8^pimgpsh_fullsize_distr-768x347.png 768w, https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/^0781FF004037D4B79628A7BE378AF74AD57D9CE673B1B12FA8^pimgpsh_fullsize_distr.png 954w" sizes="(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Irrespective of new or old, a website development company is the preferred option for most customers. It is true that these companies lose many good deals to freelancers, and it goes without saying, it is quite a concern for these companies. However, the big reason for the web development companies remaining the top choices is the availability of experts that help their clients in the long run. These companies help their employees to brush up their talents on the latest codes and other developments. Some of the reasons that make going for a web development company a better choice than working as a freelancer are given below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use of Latest Technology</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The good thing about web development companies is that they start using newer technologies as soon as they come to the market. These companies have experts who are able to understand every details of the new technology and are ready to use them immediately. The whole team works together to deliver excellent results. It is the employees working for the company that finally counts for the success of a project. In addition to working together as a team, the individual also works on their own on a specific aspect of the project. Every coder is skilled in a specific field, which could be designing, functionality, or coding. The team works with the latest technology available and works with more methods as well. There is no complexity related to approval and management of the project in these companies as every individual focuses on a specific aspect using the best technology available to make the results simpler.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Skills and Qualifications</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the team members work in a team, the skills of the individuals automatically gets developed as well. It is working on many projects that give the employees of web development companies the edge that is missing among freelancers. The skills of the employees improve each day during various gathering like group meetings. The meetings offer an opportunity for the employees to learn more and upgrade their skills as per the website being developed for the client.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In most of the cases, the individuals who are working for the company have higher qualifications compared to those of the freelancers. This has mainly to do with the increasing competition in the market that constantly forces them to get better skills and qualifications to help them to be part of the growing market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Better Communication</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another positive aspect of a web development company is that they listen to your specific needs and responds in a positive manner. They are transparent about the methods that they would implement for the project, the timeline to deliver, and the budget for developing the project. It would do well for you to speak to a web development company about all your requirements and demands, and they would work accordingly as per your needs, and will be always ready to do all that is required to finally develop your website that exactly fulfills your expectation. There is every possibility of these skilled employees out-performing their freelancer counterparts in talent. Once a web development company works for your project, you also get better testimonials because these skilled individuals are listed to all your requirements and work to that reason. You could have meetings with them whenever you think it necessary; and in the meetings, you can discuss anything and everything related to your project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>No Long Wait</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to working with a freelancer, you are bound to follow their terms and conditions of their work conditions. The time to get your project done could exceed the initial promises and they could be busy with other projects and would keep delaying your project. You might have to wait in a long queue to get your project done by the specific freelancer. In spite of being creative and skilled at working on a project, it is the final project that you receive determines the completion of the work. On the contrary, when a website development company works for your project, they will be working in a team of skilled individuals to work on your project. This has the benefit of getting the final product well in time after it is tested by groups of software testers who review it before delivering it to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Budget-Friendly </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact remains that the charges of a freelancer does not follow any norm whereas a web development company charges after taking every detail into account while handling the project. If a comparison is made between a freelancer and a web development company, it would become clear that the freelancer delivers much less when the final product is delivered. Due to their overheads, a web development company is the preferable one compared to freelancers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether it is a web development company or a freelancer that you select for your project, what is important to consider is that the website delivers your intended requirements in building the website, and the cost involved in development fits in your budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It boils down to the fact that if you need somebody to grow your business, then hiring the services of companies for <strong><a href="../../../../ecommerce-web-development-services.html">website development in Dubai</a></strong> would be the best decision you could make to fulfill your dreams. A Freelancer can also deliver the developmental task, but there are certain drawbacks that would be hard to accept if you are looking forward to grow your business really big. So these are the brass tacks to follow when hiring the services of web developers for your dream project.</p>
