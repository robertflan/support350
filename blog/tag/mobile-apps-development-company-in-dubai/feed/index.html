				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Similar to the wider changes in software development, there has been a big change in enterprise needs and challenges. There is a gradual shift in the client-enterprise interactions from the desktop to mobile devices, and that has caused an increase in requirement for suitable mobile apps development in Dubai and elsewhere for the enterprise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the creation of well-designed and successful mobile apps is quite challenging and requires considering certain factors. Here are five of the major challenges that should be addressed for a seamless experience of mobile devices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Division of Devices and Operating Systems</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the present scenario, there is significant fragmentation of operating systems and devices. To go about developing a mobile app, your first consideration would be to select from the three most popular platforms (Android, Windows, and iOS) for mobile app development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it is true that you obviously would prefer to work with configurations and capabilities for developing an app that meets the requirement of the specific vendors. In addition, you also have to take into account the needs of the client. In addition to reaching out to their customers, the client also needs to see that the app is being used for profit. Other than only considering the functionality compatibility of the app being developed, it is also necessary to know the specifics of the targeted clients of the enterprise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-217" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/09/%5E44B921E438D4D519A2563313E3149F24447F54FD8041A11E45%5Epimgpsh_fullsize_distr.jpg" alt="^44B921E438D4D519A2563313E3149F24447F54FD8041A11E45^pimgpsh_fullsize_distr" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/^44B921E438D4D519A2563313E3149F24447F54FD8041A11E45^pimgpsh_fullsize_distr-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/^44B921E438D4D519A2563313E3149F24447F54FD8041A11E45^pimgpsh_fullsize_distr-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/^44B921E438D4D519A2563313E3149F24447F54FD8041A11E45^pimgpsh_fullsize_distr.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Technology used for development </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two types of mobile app development. These are the Native app development and the Hybrid app development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Native apps are built intentionally for a specific platform (like Google&#8217;s Android, Apple&#8217;s iOS, Blackberry, or Window’s Window Phone). Unlike the web, the Native apps have the characteristics of superior application performance and better user experience, provided they are developed and designed within the operating system. The downside of the native apps is that one needs to develop apps for every platform, which takes up time and are not profitable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Usually, HTML5 is used to develop Hybrid mobile apps and could well be installed on any mobile device, and they use a web browser to run. The good thing about developing hybrid mobile apps is that the time required to build across multiple platforms is considerably lowered. The downside is that the performance of the hybrid app is hindered, and one needs to do away with some features to make it up and running. At the time of selecting the best option, you need to take into account that any wrong choice could cause the app to perform badly as the user finds the experience not up to the mark. The expenses also increase as a result. This makes it important to know the target audience of the client and their choice of mobile vendors (along with the availability of third-party vendors). All these information would help in the selection of better development technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>User interactivity and experience</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The UI/UE now is the major cause for concerns for the developers of mobile applications. The first challenge for developing the app is to include the best experience while developing the app for the client. A major concern in development is the inconsistency of the clients when it comes to the functionalities to be included in the app, and also their changing preferences for aesthetics. Another challenge for the enterprise app developer is the differences of the platforms when it comes to screen resolutions, sizes, and the available technologies. Any wrong judgment in these factors could lead to a counter-intuitive and cumbersome experience for the client, and could lead to low adaptability of the app among customers. To get over these issues, it is important to take into account the requirements of different OS, do regular fixing of bugs, and make use of icons and buttons (like “home” or “menu”) to turn the app more intuitive. It is important to make the app work on multiple platforms, along with adding interactive options like tilting, shaking, and flipping.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Content management and security</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a growing need for mobile app content and it is now becoming more dynamic with time. In addition, images, animation, and video also should be included in the content of the app. The challenge is to include all these into a uniform expansion files, which is required for some app stores. It makes sense to experiment with the many solutions for mobile content management. In addition to content management, enterprise developers should also consider security aspect of such contents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The vast opportunities that are available for both enterprises and their clients help in the possibility to access the contents of apps. However, along with the opportunities, there comes the possibility of misuse of information. It is for this reason that many enterprises prefer to use mobile device management solutions to lock their apps, which when used wrongly, could lead to poor experience among app users. On the contrary, employees do not like any kind of control on the network of companies as well as over their devices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the enterprise mobile app developer, it is important that the app so developed has server-side validation, proper authentication plans, encryption of important data to prevent the various security issues. It should however be noted that the security is flexible and quite different from other enterprises. For example, the security level and authentication that you would require is different for banking app and an online display shop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Application performance Vs battery life</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A big challenge when it comes to developing enterprise mobile app is to make sure that the app actually works fine. In addition, the app needs to be free from bugs, and it is possible to work at a lower battery power. It is important to take into consideration that the app might be working good on newer mobile devices while it is not performing so well in older versions of the devices. If the client finds that the app is now showing good performance with low batter consumption, there are good chances of the client deleting the app because they want that their handset is keeping charge for a full-day use without any further need for charging. To get over this issue, see to it that the development team works together with the prototyping efforts. See to it that the test cases are run with the app so that the users do not face performance trouble when the final version is brought out.</p>
