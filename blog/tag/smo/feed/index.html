				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep up with the evolving social media trends, businesses have witnessed a host of changes in the previous years. And in the future, companies need to pull up their socks as social media is changing rapidly. Evasive social media marketing can lead to an adverse meltdown of your promotion strategies. ‘Adopt what others are adopting’ – has become the key to surviving in the heavy competition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="../../../../social-media-marketing-services.html">Social media</a></strong> is a rather peculiar animal that makes businesses scramble each year to keep up with the dynamic trends that follow. Yet, very few actually manage to keep an eye out for the changing social media rules. The following media trends will help you cut through all that clutter and create a brand which is truly responsive to social media dynamics.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Channelize Your Messages</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You have an empowering message, but which social media do you need to be on? Businesses have missed out on their entire social message tactic because of their communication strategies misfiring on social channels. No one wants to wind up with the right message on the wrong social channel. Following blinded craze without actually analyzing whether or not your target audience is live on that specific social media platform could lead to dubious message channeling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having just a presence on social media platforms in not appealing, you need to target the bull’s-eye to ensure that your promotional messages hit the right market.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><strong>Real-Time Engagement</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to search engine watch, 73% people who share brand information expect a reply from the brand they are trying to reach out to. As a matter of fact, 53% expect or want a response in less than an hour. These statistics show how disturbing and disoriented the engagement levels are between the users and the business. This calls for faster response times by the brands for a receptive feedback process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When users share, they expect a reply and reception from the brand. Customers have the right to be attended to and your brand has a duty to fulfill. Social media is moving fast, and you need to surpass your competitor’s ability by responding to unsatisfied customers quickly.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><strong>Engage users with a ‘Buy’ button</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Directly hinted at social commerce, research has found that social influences more customers’ buying preferences and decisions than retail websites. Creating an e-commerce platform is good, but probably not the best option in today’s competitive market. There has arisen a dire need to target users through social ads on platforms like <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ehorizonweb/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/eHorizonweb/" target="_blank">Twitter</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/101470589853770200011/about" target="_blank">Google+</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ehorizon-electronic-solutions-est/" target="_blank">linkedin</a></strong> and major social links.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from short and effective advertisements, you can also opt for content strategies to provide buyers with more information on your products. Break-out from the traditional buying options and give customers a newer and creative purchasing experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-72"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-73 aligncenter" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/06/social-media-trends-to-rule-the-year-of-2016-300x153.png" alt="social-media-trends-to-rule-the-year-of-2016" width="540" height="275" srcset="https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/social-media-trends-to-rule-the-year-of-2016-300x153.png 300w, https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/social-media-trends-to-rule-the-year-of-2016-768x392.png 768w, https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/social-media-trends-to-rule-the-year-of-2016-1024x523.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><strong>Live Video Streaming</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to apps like Periscope and Meerkat, video streaming has become a favorite option for businesses and has made streaming the next big thing in social media. Be more realistic about what you do, and live videos are a sure-shot way to do that. Make users believe that you are just not reading off a paper. Demonstrate what you really do by revealing a more original and unique side of your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People tend to register visuals more than audio and content. What you show is what will define you as a brand in the market. More and more businesses today are going live with unedited videos, just to give customers a glimpse of their authenticity compared to their competitors. Your business needs to learn how to show, not tell.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><strong>Living, breathing testimonials</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This might sound like a no-brainer activity, but the employees of your company have better ties and more engagement levels over social media platforms. Employee advocacy has become the new norm, showing that employees help the business stay more relevant socially. Keep your employees active on social networks because they have the ability to retain 10 times more followers than your company page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Making them sing praises for your business is never a bad idea for the current social media trends. The engagement level is higher with employees, so make them the epitome of your company vision and message and witness the difference.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><strong>Mobiles first</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your business has still not been able to make it to mobile devices, then market-wise, your business is in a gravely rough position. Making your way to users’ mobile has become a necessity more than a requirement. Be it for surfing or purchasing, mobile usability has succeeded in an enormous way, especially because who has the time? People want to make purchases on the go and users need information in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mobile devices and tablets need to be your focus point if you want to stay ahead in the competition. In addition to this, smart TV’s and smart watches are coming in a big way, but you need to stay on the mobile marketing train for a direct interaction and communication with potential customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Irrespective of what the global scenario is currently, social media is here to stay. It has become one of the strongest and influential tools for a mass-target approach. Dig deeper into your marketing strategies and study the revolution being brought about by these latest social media trends. To be successful, set the ball rolling by keeping pace with the diversely changing social media trends.</p>
