				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The earlier and first version of Penguin practically revolutionized the structure of off-page SEO completely. It released an unnatural spam signal that immediately detected sites guilty of link scheming from the SERP’s. And with the upcoming real-time update of Penguin, spammy links will be tweaked and removed faster than a blink of an eye.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SEOs have been having an enjoyable time with unnatural links for better traffic and conversion rates. Sadly, Penguin is arriving just to kill that joy once and for all. With the real-time feature, Penguin will also be on the continuous watch for spam-linked websites.</p>
<div id="attachment_80" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-80 size-full" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/06/get-your-websites-ready-for-penguin-4.0.jpg" alt="Get Your Websites Ready For Penguin 4.0," width="1200" height="598" srcset="https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/get-your-websites-ready-for-penguin-4.0-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/get-your-websites-ready-for-penguin-4.0-768x383.jpg 768w, https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/get-your-websites-ready-for-penguin-4.0-1024x510.jpg 1024w, https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/get-your-websites-ready-for-penguin-4.0.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Get Your Websites Ready For Penguin 4.0,</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is time for SEOs to pull up their socks and go for a comprehensive Penguin link audit to actually tackle those scary moves that Google will begin throwing. After all, it is better to be safe than sorry, especially when you know you can lose out on a huge business if you don’t start taking necessary precautions starting from now. Although no official news or update has been making the rounds yet, there is no doubt that Google Penguin will hit SEOs real hard when they actually start making the rounds.</p>
<ul class="service-list service-list02">
<li><strong>Prepare a list of the links and domains</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To begin filtering out, first and foremost, you need to prepare an entire list of all the external links and referring domains that link to your current website. There are tools that can literally help you do that in a much simpler manner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Try out Google Search Console or <strong><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/" target="_blank">SEO</a></strong> PowerSuite. Powerful equipment such as these can pull out the links and domains associated with your website, making it easier for you to actually detect the number of backlinks that your website has.</p>
<ul class="service-list service-list02">
<li><strong>Eliminate the Chaos</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Use SEO SpyGlass (a part of SEO PowerSuite) to help understand and analyze the status of each link and domain you have on your list. You have to remove links that no longer are connected to your site. You would expect Google to already have removed them, but there are some links that the master does not remove with immediate effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Links that have a ‘no follow’ attribute although can be a star when it comes to bringing traffic to your website. However, if they don’t have a link base or if they come from non-authoritative domains, it is better you remove it before Google Penguin does once it’s out in the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything cut short; remove links and useless domains that are literally of no help to your website. Just remember that traffic website is not the only countable matter in this whole humdrum. The point is to eliminate links that no longer exist or those domains that can actually put your website in trouble in the later stages.</p>
<ul class="service-list service-list02">
<li><strong>Spot the Links Carrying Penalty Risks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is where the main action gets started. You have removed all the noise, so it’s time to focus on the music. Existing links that can be dangerous or risky based on Google&#8217;s algorithms to detect spammy and unnatural links have to be taken down. Using SEO SpyGlass, you can immediately find out the penalty risk each of your backlinks carry and take action thereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This tool also helps you understand why the link or domain is considered risky because obviously you want a reason to take that link down. Your backlinks get segregated according to the risk percentage that follows it. After that, it is all on you on whether or not you want to take some action on such risky link domains.</p>
<ul class="service-list service-list02">
<li><strong>Check for Traffic-Bringing Risky Links</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some links could be toxic, yet they could still bring your website immense traffic. Before you out rightly disavow them, use SpyGlass and determine the risky links and domains that are currently bringing traffic to your website. Just because they are risky doesn&#8217;t not mean their performance is essentially poor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You don’t want to lose that handful of visitors that are being actually being gifted by such unnatural links. So think before you take a call. If you find some prominent traffic flow from risky domains, contact webmasters and take necessary action with respect to no follow requests. Up till this stage, keep these useful yet risky domains in hand.</p>
<ul class="service-list service-list02">
<li><strong>Contact Webmasters</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Google requires a request for a link removal before we disavow risky and spammy links. Reaching out to webmasters was previously difficult, which has been made comparatively easy by SEO PowerSuite’s LinkAssistant tool. If you want to send out emails for link removals manually, you will have a hard time seeking the contact details of webmasters. Make it easy on yourself and save tons of time by using the LinkAssistant tool to quickly approve and take down dangerous website backlinks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make a list of all the risky links that require a shut to their services based on the above-mentioned prerequisites. Don’t underestimate the consequences of Google penalties by acting a little smart and keeping traffic generating yet spammy links or domains. Stay safe from the traps by sending link removal and no-follow requests to webmasters for taking them down off search engines.</p>
<ul class="service-list service-list02">
<li><strong>Disavow, When Everything In Vain</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If, by whatever chance, you fail to contact the webmaster or do not receive a reply from them after days and weeks have passed, disavow the toxic links/domains. However, keep the disavow option open for the last resort. Although you disavow such links and get rid of them in a definite way, you will still have to maintain a record and submit it to Google.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can create a disavow file on the SpyGlass’ tool. Just go to each link and start adding them one by one to the disavow list. At the end, you will find a separate section maintained containing all the toxic and spammy links you have removed. You can generate the file using this tool itself, and later on go to Google Search Console’s Disavow Tool and upload the same.</p>
<ul class="service-list service-list02">
<li><strong>Spot the Weak Points</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that your major task is done, you can start building up links that could actually sound and fruitful for your business. The next step is to focus on the performance of your competitors and see in what areas your website is lagging behind. Use the Domain Comparison tool of SEO SpyGlass, put in the URL’s of your competitors and analyze the differences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will notice all the websites rankings and how specific backlink-related factors are actually affecting your business to theirs. To carve your niche, research in detail about link intersection and backlink factors. Check out what domains are linked to multiple websites and how that relation is actually proving to be good for them. Tag these domains for you to contact them later and get in the same place or at a better stand in the niche. Acting on such link opportunities will help you with a deeper insight of your competitors’ backlink strategies and how they are optimizing the target keywords for better traffic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Put in or keep a record of the domains and links that can necessitate the same success or even better for your website as compared to your competitors. One thing here, just removing spammy links is not important. What&#8217;s more important is that you remove what is not required and place/use what is actually required.</p>
<ul class="service-list service-list02">
<li><strong>Keep your link profile clean for Google</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With Penguin becoming real-time, it is going to definitely jeopardize the mannerisms and structures of SEOs. Constant evaluation and regular link-auditing should undoubtedly become a part of your SEO routine. And with tools like SEO PowerSuite, maintaining link profiles is really not that cumbersome anymore. The first time that you assess for domain checks and link audits, don&#8217;t forget to tag them which will make the next routine check easy only for you. What&#8217;s more, follow these basic steps and conduct occasional link audit processes to make your websites Penguin-proof.</p>
