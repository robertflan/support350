<p>&nbsp;</p>

The utility of the device has also increased with an increase in the number of features. The growing popularity of iPhone has made it important for making a website compatible with iPhone so that a greater section of people can get access to their business website.

So instead of dilly-dallying in making a decision, hire the services of eHorizon, the company for iPhone application development in Dubai.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is after the launch of iPhone 5 and iOS 6 mobile, Apple reported of the manifold growth in popularity of iPhone. iPhone offers a platform to help developers in developing unique and innovative applications. Some of the important reasons that make developing application on iPhone platform for your business the right choice are given below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are different brands of Smartphone available in the market, with iPhone leading all. Statistics show that over 6 million of iPhone handsets have been sold till now and the figures are only increasing. Hence, <a href="../../../../iphone-application-development-services.html" target="_blank">iPhone application development provides</a> a huge opportunity to bring your products or services to the millions of users across the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One can download iPhone SDK and use it to develop and market iPhone app on the Apple App Store. All the required tools for developing iPhone application are available in the iPhone SDK.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Although a good number of benefits are available from using iPhone application, some restrictions have been put by Apple for developing an application. Some of these restrictions are given below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Restrictions on iPhone applications</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest restriction is that two applications cannot be run by the user at the same time in spite of their importance. For instance, if one application is running and there is a need to use the other application to complete the work, the first application should be closed before moving on to the next application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another restriction is that you cannot run third-party applications in iPhone in the background.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are instances of issues related to iOS compatibility. Hence, if an iOS 6 application is developed, you need to include scripts in the application to make it compatible with the previous versions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To wrap it up, although these limitations could sometimes turn out to be frustrating, these have not significant effect on the sale of iPhone. This is amply proved from the statistics that prove that iPhone still remains as the leading Smartphone in the market and holds over 30% of the Smartphone market share. That iPhone is the most popular Smartphone in the world is proved by the fact that over 7, 00,000 iPhone applications are available on the World Wide Web. And the huge benefits that the user finds with iPhone applications is simply enough to overpower the limitations of the applications.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the launch of iOS6 and iPhone5, there has been a sharp rise in the popularity of iPhone. The users of iPhone4s are upgrading their software to iOS6. This is to be believed given the fact that there are over 200 new features available in the iOS6. Due to the huge popularity of iPhone, many developers and programmers have come up with thousands of applications that made the handset more practical and useful for those using it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those having an idea of an application would find selecting the iPhone platform the right choice. Here are some reasons that support your choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-205" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/07/What-makes-iPhone-popular-for-your-application-idea.jpg" alt="What makes iPhone popular for your application idea" width="1250" height="720" srcset="https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/What-makes-iPhone-popular-for-your-application-idea-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/What-makes-iPhone-popular-for-your-application-idea-768x442.jpg 768w, https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/What-makes-iPhone-popular-for-your-application-idea-1024x590.jpg 1024w, https://www.ehorizon.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/What-makes-iPhone-popular-for-your-application-idea.jpg 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What makes iPhone popular for your application idea?</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Among the different brands of Smartphone available in the market, it is the iPhone that tops the list.</li>
<li>Approximately 6 million sets of iPhone have been sold till now, and the sale is seeing no sign of slowing down. iPhone provides a tremendous opportunity to market your application idea to millions of users worldwide.</li>
<li>One can download SDK of iPhone, create applications accordingly and upload for distribution on the Apple App Store. This kit contains the various tools that are required for developing iPhone application. A good number of companies for iPhone application development in Dubai have been working in developing and marketing applications for iPhone, and these companies are available for hiring in developing your idea into iPhone application.</li>
<li>The huge popularity of iPhone applications: Users of iPhone find using applications developed for iPhone quite helpful and easy to perform numerous tasks, funny activities, etc. with their handsets. It goes without saying that iPhone is not just a Smartphone, but a part of life for the user.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are some of the important benefits of developing applications on iPhone platform. However, Apple has implemented some restrictions on development of applications and running them on Apple device. Some of the restrictions that should be considered when planning to work for iPhone applications are given below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>iPhone applications &#8211; Restrictions and limitations </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apple has introduced a major restriction to users of iPhone in not letting two applications to run at the same time, even if both the applications are important. Hence, if one is working with one application, and there is a need for another application to perform simultaneously, then the first application need to be closed before moving to the other application. This could be quite frustrating at times, more so when say, one is checking the email or browsing the internet, and there is a need to call someone, in which case, you will be disconnected from the server once you start making the call. Later on, after the call is finished, you will be required to sign in again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another limitation in using iPhone is that it is not possible to run a third party application. Hence when chatting with someone in an application you receive a call, you will find getting disconnected from the chat window as you take the call, while the other party in chatting will find you offline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There could be compatibility issues with the iOS version. Hence, if an application is developed for the iOS6, the developer has to put some extra effort in development to make the application compatible with the previous versions and help it run properly in the different versions. Although there is no such incident of this type of issue happening, this could pose a problem for developers and programmers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In spite of these limitations that are at times frustrating, it should be noted that the sale of iPhone or its popularity has not waned in any way over the years. iPhone still remains the market leader in smartphone sales, holding about 30% of the market. Presently, the number of iPhone applications that are found on the internet is over 700,000. It clearly proves that the benefits and popularity of iPhone applications overcome the limitations and restrictions by Apple that are in place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Games</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most popular iPhone application development and possibly, the most challenging are developing iPhone games. It needs mentioning here that the cost of developing a game is always more than that of other apps, because to develop, the best and competent developers are hired to work towards coding for the games. Even to code the simplest game, the coding required is complex and dynamic, and is done in the backend.  There are different options available in playing a game, including maintaining the scores, making and integration with an online community, etc. Hence implementing the options could turn out to be quite complicated, as the different moves in a game need sounds, and other features. It is only the well-established development companies that are involved in developing iPhone games as a huge capital investment is involved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The decision in the type of iPhone application that you have in mind to develop finally depends on your overall budget. If you are new in the business of iPhone application development and trying your luck, then it makes sense to take into account all the aspects before setting about the project. A good number of trustworthy and reputable companies for <strong><a href="../../../../iphone-application-development-services.html" target="_blank">iPhone application development in Dubai</a></strong> like eHorizon offer design and development services along with consultancy services. Once hired, these companies assign a team of professionals that work closely with you, as they discuss and plan accordingly to make your mobile application a success. They lay out the numerous technological options that they would use to code for the application, and also perform a dummy run to ensure the correct working of the application.</p>
